# Running Python on Scrimba with Brython

Brython is a plugin. It allows us to write python code that then gets recompiled into Javascript and can then run on the Scrimba platform or any other platforms.
You will find this in `index.html`.

## Brython oddities in Scrimba
- The input() box is really the JS prompt and note seen in cast but works when you run local code.
- The scrimba minibrowsers hovers in the corners in some tutorials, dont worry about it.
