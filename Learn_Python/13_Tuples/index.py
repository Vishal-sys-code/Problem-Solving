# Tuple cannot be changed when we created the first time that is fixed, if you want to change it then create another tuple and copy that tuple there.
# Tuple is faster than regular lists.
# Tuple is more memory efficient than regular lists.
# Tuple is more secure than regular lists. Because it is immutable.
